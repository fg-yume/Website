			<p>I'm Freddy Garcia, a student at Rochester Institute of Technology currently pursuing a B.S. in Game Design and Development. Although programming is my strong point when it comes to game development, I absolutely love the design phases of games. Listening to others' ideas as well as sharing my own has always been something that I find extremely enjoyable.</p>
			<p>Examples of my work can be found throughout the various pages on this site. Feel free to take a look around, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or simply want to chat.</p>

		<h2>Highlight - RIT iOS App Challenge 2014: Chocofling</h2>
		<p>The original submission can be found <a href="http://ritios.challengepost.com/submissions/20587-chocofling">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Chocofling is a casual game built using the Sprite Kit framework. The goal behind Chocofling is to accrue as many points as possible by coating falling food with fondue. The fondue supply is limited; the game is over once the supply is depleted. Non-food objects will also fall, and will negatively impact the players' score if coated with fondue. In addition, powerups will also spawn, changing the dynamics of the game.</p>
